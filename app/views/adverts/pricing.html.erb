      I was very curious how GoodUI Datastories would be. After receiving the first issue I can say that it’s a great piece of professional work. I was feeling like sitting right next to Jakub and Vlad while they prepared and ran the tests. It’s a great thing to have everything provided in such detail. Imagine as if you actually ran these tests but it took you just a reading moment and not 3 months. Great isn’t it? ”
